### Question

Let X = x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, . . . , x<sub>m</sub> and Y = y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, . . . , y<sub>n</sub> be two sequences.

A common supersequence of X and Y is another sequence to which X and Y are both subsequences.

Suppose X = a, b, d, c and Y = b, a, b, e, d, a trivial common supersequence of X and Y is simply the concatenation of X and Y. A shorter one is b, a, b, e, d, c.

Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the shortest common supersequence of X and Y.
