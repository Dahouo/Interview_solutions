### Arithmetic Progression

An arithmetic progression is a sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... a<sub>n</sub> such that the difference between any 2 consecutive numbers in the sequence is the same.

Mathematically, for every i < n, j < n, we have a<sub>i+1</sub> - a<sub>i</sub> == a<sub>j+1</sub> - a<sub>j</sub>.

For example, `1, 3, 5, 7, 9` is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2.


### Question

You are given a sorted array (with 3 or more elements) that represents an arithmetic progression with 1 missing element. Design an algorithm to find the missing element. The missing element is guaranteed to be somewhere between the first and last element (exclusive). For example, if A = [1,3,7,9,11] then your algorithm should return 5.
