### Question

- You are given an array of `n` integers where `2 <= n <= 100`
- Find the maximum number of integers you can select from the array where the absolute difference between any 2 of the numbers is less than or equal to 1.
- Example, for [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], the selected numbers would be [4, 4, 5, 5, 5], so our solution is 5.
