- You start with an array of all 0s, where we refer to the initial element in the array as index 1.
- There are `m` operations done on the array, where each operation is represented by `a`, `b`, `k`
  - `a` is the start index (where array starts at index 1)
  - `b` is the end index
  - `k` is the value
- For each index between `a` and `b` inclusive, you must add `k` to every element in the array
