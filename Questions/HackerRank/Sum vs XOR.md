### Question

Given an integer `n`, find each `x` where

- 0 <= x <= n
- n + x = n ⊕ x

where ⊕ represents bitwise XOR. Print the total number of integers `x` satisfying the criteria.


For example, if n = 4, there are four values that satisfy the criteria
```
4 + 0 = 4 ⊕ 0 = 4
4 + 1 = 4 ⊕ 1 = 5
4 + 2 = 4 ⊕ 2 = 6
4 + 3 = 4 ⊕ 3 = 7
```

so the solution is 4.
