### Question

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase letters a-z. It is theoretically repeated infinitely many times.

Given an integer `n`, find and print the number of letter `a`s in the first `n` letters of the infinite string.

Example: given `s = "abcac"` and `n = 10`, the substring we consider is `abcacabcac`. The letter `a` occurs 4 times, which is what we return as our solution.
