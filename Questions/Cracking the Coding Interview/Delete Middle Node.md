### Question

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.

### Example

- Input: the node `c` from the linked list __a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f__
- Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like __a -> b -> d -> e -> f__
