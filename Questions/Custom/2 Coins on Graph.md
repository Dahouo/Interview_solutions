### Question

Let `G` be a connected undirected graph. Suppose we start with two coins on two arbitrarily chosen vertices of `G`. At every step, each coin must move to an adjacent vertex. Describe and analyze an algorithm that given `G` and starting vertices `s`, `t` (which may or may not be distinct) correctly decides whether the game can reach a configuration where both coins are on the same vertex. Can you think of an instance where the desired configuration is not reachable?

Hint: Form a graph, but NOT the one you are given.
