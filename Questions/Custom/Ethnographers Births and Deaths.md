### Question

A group of ethnographers have been interviewing members of a village to learn about the lives of people who lived hundreds of years back. From these interviews they have learned about a set of n people (all now deceased) whom we will denote by P1, P2, . . . Pn. The facts they have learned about these people has one of two forms

- For some i and j, person P<sub>i</sub> died before person P<sub>j</sub> was born, or
- For some i and j, the life spans of P<sub>i</sub> and P<sub>j</sub>overlapped at least partially.

The ethnographers want to determine if these facts could be consistent, that is, there could have been n people whose birth and death dates are consistent with the facts they have collected through the interviews.

Design a linear time algorithm (in the number of people and the facts they have collected) that determines consistency.
