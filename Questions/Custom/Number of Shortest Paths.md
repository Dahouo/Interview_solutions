### Question

Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph, and let u, v be two vertices of G. Give an algorithm that computes the number of shortest paths between u and v in G. Your algorithm should not list all the paths; it should just compute the number. The running time of your algorithm should be O(n + m) where n = |V| and m = |E|.
