### Provided code

Let's assume we're given the following `Node` class, with variables marked `public` for simplicity.
```java
class Node {
    public Node next = null;
    public int data = 0;
}
```

### Algorithm

1. `k` = # of nodes from beginning of list to beginning of loop
1. `n` = loop size
1. When `slow` enters loop (after `k` nodes), `fast` is `k` nodes into the list.
1. That means they will meet in `n - k` steps (Since they get 1 step closer each time).
1. When they meet, `slow` is `n - k` steps into the loop, so `slow` will be at beginning of loop in `k` single steps.

### Solution

```java
Node findBeginning(Node head) {
    Node slow = head; // moves at normal speed
    Node fast = head; // moves at double speed

    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast) { // they collided
            break;
        }
    }

    /*
     * Error Check - Detects if no loop was found. Don't forget this step!
     */
    if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
        return null;
    }

    /*
     * Put "slow2" at head of list. Move "slow" and "slow2" 1 step at a
     * time. They collide at head of cycle
     */
    Node slow2 = head;
    while (slow2 != slow) {
        slow = slow.next;
        slow2 = slow2.next;
    }
    return slow;
}
```
