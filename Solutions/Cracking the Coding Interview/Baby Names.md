### Solution

- Represent this as a Graph. Names are Nodes. Pairs of names are Edges.
- Generating the desired output is simply doing a [BFS](https://github.com/RodneyShag/Interview_solutions/blob/master/Questions/Breadth-First%20Search.md) or [DFS](https://github.com/RodneyShag/Interview_solutions/blob/master/Questions/Depth-First%20Search.md) on each connected
  component, while summing the values at each node.
